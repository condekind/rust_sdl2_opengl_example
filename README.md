# Rust SDL2 Playground

⚠️ WIP! ⚠️

This is a test repo to learn and evaluate SDL2 bindings for rust

Initially, it's mainly a rewrite of a C++ program I wrote that does the same thing. It implements the [game loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) from Bob Nystrom's [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) (which I strongly recommend). This was a close 1:1 rewrite, so you might see old comments referencing wrong variable names - they will be cleaned up eventually.

The background you see in the sample is part of Ulrick Wery's [Hand Painted Textures](https://ulrickwery.artstation.com/projects/V2WOb), which as far as I'm aware, are not free to distribute, so they're not included in this repo. Support the artist if you like his work.
